Functionality and features
==========================

The following features are built-in into Connection Manager:
	- Generic plugin infrastructure
	- Device and network abstraction (with basic storage support)
	- IPv4, routing and DNS configuration
	- DNS Proxy

Various plugins can be enabled for networking support:
	- Ethernet plugin
	- WiFi plugin with WEP40/WEP128 and WPA/WPA2 (personal only) support
	- Bluetooth plugin

Also plugins with additional features are available:
	- Loopback setup
	- PolicyKit support


Compilation and installation
============================

In order to compile Connection Manager you need following software packages:
	- GCC compiler
	- GLib library
	- D-Bus library
	- PolicyKit (optional)

To configure run:
	./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var

Configure automatically searches for all required components and packages.

To compile and install run:
	make && make install


VPN
===

In order to compile pptp and l2tp VPN plugins, you need ppp development
package.

To run l2tp you will need
	- xl2tpd, http://www.xelerance.com/services/software/xl2tpd

To run pptp you will need
	- pptp client, http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net

Both l2tp and pptp also need pppd.


Configuration and options
=========================

For a working system, certain configuration options need to be enabled:

	--enable-ethernet

		Enable support for Ethernet network cards

	--enable-wifi

		Enable support for WiFi devices (requires wpa_supplicant)


	--enable-bluetooth

		Enable support for Bluetooth devices (requires BlueZ)

	--enable-loopback

		Enable setup of loopback device

		For distributions with a really minimal init system and no
		networking scripts this can take care of setting up the
		loopback device and enabling it.

		It is safe to select this option even if networking scripts
		are in place. It detects an already configured loopback
		device and leaves it as it is.

	--enable-polkit

		Enable support for PolicyKit authorization

		This allows to check every D-Bus access against a security
		policy and so restrict access to certain functionality.
